     *  I'm going to call the first, third, fifth, ... elements of a
     *  list the "odd-position elements". This means I'm indexing
     *  from one. Please don't sue me. If your solution indexed from
     *  zero, that's fine; the code will be slightly different.
     *
     *  If you assume the list is really long, then its odd-position
     *  elements are the first element, followed by the odd-position
     *  elements of the list you get by deleting the first two
     *  elements. Or, to put it another way, you get the answer by
     *  taking the odd-position elements of that sublist (which you
     *  get by calling tail.tail.everyOtherValue(), with the first
     *  element stuck on the front (which you get by calling cons()
     *  on that list.
     *
     *  That works if the list's length is at least three. If the
     *  list's length is one or two, the output is just the first
     *  element. Notice that I'm not using the length() method to
     *  find out the length: that would be inefficient, as it must
     *  walk all the way down the list to calculate its exact
     *  length. We don't need to know the exact length: we just
     *  need to know if it's one, two or something else.
