     *  If t_s is much less than t_a, customers arrive rarely and are
     *  served fast. This means that the queue is usually empty, so an
     *  average customer will be served almost immediately and, there-
     *  fore, the amount of time they spend in the system will be about
     *  the average service time -- slightly more, because they might
     *  have to queue briefly.
     *
     *  If t_s > t_a, the queue just gets longer and longer: people are
     *  arriving in the queue faster than they're being served.
     *
     *  If t_s = t_a, you might expect things to be OK -- on average, a
     *  person arrives every t_a minutes but also one person leaves. In
     *  fact, though, the queue gets longer and longer again. The reason
     *  is that it's possible to be unlucky and either have several
     *  customers arrive in rapid succession, or have several customers
     *  take longer than average to be served. This makes the queue get
     *  longer. Once the queue is long, it will take a while to clear
     *  and, if you're unlucky again in that time, the queue gets even
     *  longer. Then it takes even longer to clear and you have even more
     *  chance of being unlucky and everything snowballs.
     *
     *  On the other hand, you might be lucky: you might have a period of
     *  time with few customers arriving and/or a succession of customers
     *  who are served quickly. Why doesn't this compensate for the
     *  unlucky periods? The answer is that bad luck can build up forever
     *  but good luck can't: you can't do better than an empty queue, but
     *  however long your queue is, it can still get worse.  For example,
     *  suppose that being unlucky for an hour adds 20 people to the
     *  queue and being lucky for an hour removes 20 people. If you're
     *  unlucky for an hour, then lucky for the next hour, then unlucky
     *  for an hour, the queue ends up with 20 people in it. However, it's
     *  just as likely that you'll be lucky for the first hour, then
     *  unlucky for two hours straight, ending up with 40 people in the
     *  queue. That first hour of good luck didn't help you, because you
     *  weren't able to remove people from the queue who hadn't arrived
     *  yet. To put it another way, the queue can't have negative length,
     *  which introduces an asymmetry.
