/*******************************************************************
 *  Lab 3, exercise 3.                                             *
 *******************************************************************
 *  A program to test the height of randomly generated binary search
 *  trees. Bruce Reed's paper "The height of a random binary search
 *  tree" (Journal of the ACM, vol. 50, no. 3, 2003) proves that,
 *  for large n, if you put the numbers 0, ..., n-1 into a BST in a
 *  random order, the average height of the resulting tree is
 *  4.311ln n - 1.953ln(ln n) + k for some constant k.
 *
 *  The lab exercise says to make the tree by adding n random
 *  numbers from the full range that an int variable can hold. I
 *  assumed that would be a reasonable approximation to adding
 *  the numbers 0, ..., n-1 in random order. You'll get a small
 *  number of duplicates but I figured there wouldn't be enough to
 *  make much difference to the height of the tree. However, I found
 *  the results weren't very good. I thought this might be because
 *  on average, there are large gaps between the random numbers and
 *  this might affect the shape of the tree.
 *
 *  Because of that, I rewrote my code to use random orderings of
 *  0, ..., n-1. To do that, I set up an array containing the
 *  numbers in order, and then use the Fisher-Yates shuffling
 *  algorithm to create a random permutation of them. You should
 *  remember Fisher-Yates as the correct way to shuffle an array,
 *  since usually people just do some random-looking swaps that
 *  don't generate all the possibilities with equal probability.
 *  (Fisher-Yates is not examinable.)
 *
 *  The results still weren't as good as I would have liked but
 *  1000 trials with trees of size 0.25M, 0.5M, 1M, 2M and 4M
 *  nodes suggests that the value of k is about -5.3. The proof only
 *  applies to "large enough" trees but I'm surprised the results
 *  weren't being consistent even in the first decimal place when
 *  considering trees as large as four million nodes.  Nonetheless,
 *  I think this is reasonable confirmation of the actual size.
